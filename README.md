# P-MNIST-41milestone

The MNIST database of handwritten digits is one of the most commonly used dataset for training various image processing systems and machine learning algorithms. MNIST has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.
MNIST is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. The original black and white (bilevel) images from NIST were size normalized. The resulting images contain grey levels as a result of the anti-aliasing technique used by the normalization algorithm. The images were centered in a 28 × 28 image by computing the center of mass of the pixels, and translating the image so as to position this point at the center of the 28 × 28 field.
